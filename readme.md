# Ajax API Calls

Slowly iterating on this website to practice and test out new html/css/javascript as I go

## Changelog

### 5/4

Completed changed the script.js file to use the fetch() API instead of Ajax.  79 or so lines down to 39.  Not bad.  And its a lot easier to read and understand.  Old js file is oldscript.js.  

#### Todo

- Make the first price call async so that it fills in the prices when the page loads instead of having to press the button
